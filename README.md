# Movie-Recommender-System

Our project is a movies and TV shows web-based adaptive real-time recommendation system. It is a website hosted locally which asks the user to select a minimum of 10 movies, and rate them on a scale of 1-5. The system is based on collaborative
filtering, and uses singular value decomposition (SVD). SVD worked best for the application of various algorithms we tested.

Developed collaboratively by Rapheal, Swapnil and Nischal.
